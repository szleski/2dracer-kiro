# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a top-down view 2D racing game with a retro aesthetic. The game focuses on fun gameplay while experimenting with different car dynamics simulation mechanisms and AI behavior. The game includes a track editor for creating custom tracks and ships with at least one non-oval track for multi-lap racing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control a car in a top-down 2D racing environment, so that I can experience engaging racing gameplay with realistic car physics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses movement keys THEN the car SHALL respond with appropriate acceleration, steering, and braking
2. WHEN the car moves THEN the physics simulation SHALL apply realistic forces including momentum, friction, and turning dynamics
3. WHEN the car reaches high speeds THEN the handling SHALL become more challenging to simulate realistic driving physics
4. WHEN the car collides with track boundaries THEN the car SHALL bounce or slide realistically based on impact angle and speed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to race against AI-controlled cars, so that I can have competitive and challenging gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a race starts THEN AI cars SHALL be present on the track with varying skill levels
2. WHEN AI cars navigate the track THEN they SHALL follow racing lines and attempt to overtake when possible
3. WHEN AI cars encounter the player's car THEN they SHALL react appropriately by avoiding collisions or competing for position
4. WHEN AI cars make mistakes THEN they SHALL recover in a believable manner that adds to gameplay challenge

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to race on a pre-built track with multiple laps, so that I can enjoy immediate gameplay without needing to create content first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN there SHALL be at least one complete racing track available
2. WHEN the player selects the default track THEN it SHALL be a non-oval design with curves, straights, and interesting features
3. WHEN the player completes a lap THEN the game SHALL track lap times and lap count
4. WHEN the player races multiple laps THEN the game SHALL maintain position tracking relative to AI opponents

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a creative player, I want to design and build my own racing tracks, so that I can customize my racing experience and experiment with different track layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player opens the track editor THEN they SHALL be able to place track segments, curves, and boundaries
2. WHEN the player designs a track THEN they SHALL be able to test drive it to verify it works correctly
3. WHEN the player saves a custom track THEN it SHALL be available for racing with AI opponents
4. WHEN the player creates track elements THEN the editor SHALL provide visual feedback and prevent invalid configurations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have a retro aesthetic similar to classic mobile racing games like Black Mamba Racer, so that I can enjoy clean, minimalist visuals that enhance the racing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game renders graphics THEN it SHALL use a muted color palette with grays, whites, and selective color accents (red, yellow)
2. WHEN cars are displayed THEN they SHALL be simple geometric shapes (arrow-like sprites) rather than detailed vehicle graphics
3. WHEN the track is rendered THEN it SHALL feature clean boundaries with checkered patterns, tire barriers, and clear visual separation
4. WHEN the UI is displayed THEN it SHALL use clean, minimalist fonts and simple geometric elements
5. WHEN sound effects play THEN they SHALL have a chiptune or 8-bit style characteristic of retro games
6. WHEN the HUD is shown THEN it SHALL include essential race information (lap count, time, mini-map) in a clean, unobtrusive layout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my racing performance, so that I can track my improvement and compete for better times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player completes a lap THEN the game SHALL display the current lap time
2. WHEN the player finishes a race THEN the game SHALL show final position, best lap time, and total race time
3. WHEN the player races multiple times THEN the game SHALL track and display personal best times
4. WHEN the player competes against AI THEN the game SHALL show real-time position and gap information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual elements that match the Black Mamba Racer aesthetic, so that I can experience the clean, focused racing environment of classic mobile racing games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN track boundaries are rendered THEN they SHALL use tire barriers (black circular elements) and checkered patterns for visual clarity
2. WHEN the mini-map is displayed THEN it SHALL show a simplified track layout in the corner with current position indicators
3. WHEN cars leave tire marks THEN they SHALL be subtle gray trails that fade over time
4. WHEN the camera follows the player THEN it SHALL maintain a consistent top-down perspective with smooth movement
5. WHEN track surfaces are rendered THEN they SHALL use subtle texture variations (asphalt gray, grass green) without overwhelming detail
6. WHEN race elements are displayed THEN they SHALL use clear visual hierarchy with high contrast for important information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to experiment with different car physics simulation approaches, so that I can find the most engaging and realistic driving feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing car physics THEN the system SHALL support multiple simulation models (arcade vs realistic)
2. WHEN switching physics models THEN the change SHALL be noticeable in car handling characteristics
3. WHEN testing physics models THEN each SHALL provide distinct driving experiences suitable for different player preferences
4. WHEN physics parameters are adjusted THEN the changes SHALL be reflected immediately in gameplay
